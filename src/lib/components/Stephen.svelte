    <p class="text-lg mt-6 text-slate-500">
      Stephen is the founder and president of Plant Joy. Although a self-professed “nobody from nowhere,” Stephen has
      been blessed by God to have a gracious impact on people who have experienced his gospel-drenched leadership.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-6 text-slate-500">
      By the grace of God, a transformative encounter with Christ in college ignited a deep love for God that propelled
      him into Gospel ministry in 2003. Set apart for kingdom leadership, Stephen pursued theological training and
      gospel ministry in church planting. After 13 years of planting churches and assisting in church-planting
      endeavors, he gradually transitioned to mentoring and coaching ministry leaders from his home base of North
      Carolina. In 2023, he became the founder and president of Plant Joy Ministries.
